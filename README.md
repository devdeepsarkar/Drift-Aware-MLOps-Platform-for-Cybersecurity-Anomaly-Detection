# Microservices-Based Drift-Aware MLOps for Cybersecurity Log Anomaly Detection

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete, production-grade **MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)** and **DevOps CI/CD pipeline** for a CyberSecurity Log Anomaly Detection system.

The core application is implemented in **Python** using **FastAPI** and **Scikit-Learn**. It employs a hybrid machine learning approach to ensure robust security:
*   **Random Forest Classifier**: A powerful supervised learning model used to accurately identify and categorize known network attacks (e.g., DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R) based on historical signatures and patterns.
*   **Autoencoders (Deep Learning)**: An unsupervised neural network architecture used to detect novel, "Zero-Day" threats by learning the normal baseline of network traffic and flagging any anomalous deviations that bypass the Random Forest.

The project integrates multiple industry-standard DevOps tools to automate the entire lifecycle—from training and testing to containerization, orchestration, and continuous monitoring.

The main objective of this project is to implement a **Self-Healing MLOps Pipeline** that not only automates deployment but also monitors model performance (Drift Detection) and triggers automated retraining when data patterns change.

## DevOps & MLOps Pipeline Overview

The automated pipeline performs the following critical stages:

### 1. Source Code Management & CI
*   **Version Control:** Managed via Git/GitHub with branch protection.
*   **Continuous Integration:** A **Jenkins** pipeline is triggered on every commit to validate code, run linting, and prepare for containerization.

### 2. Automated ML Pipeline
*   **Baseline Generation:** A Kubernetes Job handles the initial data download (NSL-KDD dataset) and generates baseline statistics.
*   **Model Training:** Automated training of the Random Forest and Autoencoder models.
*   **Artifact Versioning:** Trained models (`.pkl`) and preprocessors are saved to **Persistent Volumes (PVC)** to ensure persistence across pod restarts.

### 3. Containerization & Registry
*   **Docker:** Every microservice (Frontend, Prediction, Drift Detection) is containerized using optimized Dockerfiles.
*   **Image Versioning:** Jenkins automatically builds and tags images with short Git SHAs, pushing them to a registry for deployment.

### 4. Infrastructure as Code & Orchestration
*   **Kubernetes (K8s):** The system is orchestrated on Kubernetes, utilizing **Deployments**, **Services**, **PVCs**, and **Ingress Controllers** for traffic routing.
*   **Ansible:** Deployment is handled via **Ansible Playbooks** that template Kubernetes manifests dynamically based on Jenkins build parameters.

### 5. Drift Detection & Self-Healing
*   **Continuous Monitoring:** A dedicated **Drift Detection Service** monitors the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistics of incoming traffic.
*   **Auto-Retraining:** If model drift is detected (e.g., a change in network traffic patterns), the service automatically triggers the ML Pipeline job to retrain the model and signals the Prediction Service to hot-reload the new artifacts without downtime.

### 6. Centralized Logging (ELK Stack)
*   **Elasticsearch & Kibana:** All system logs are indexed for high-speed searching and visualization.
*   **Fluent Bit:** Acts as a lightweight log processor and forwarder, collecting container logs and shipping them to the EFK stack.
